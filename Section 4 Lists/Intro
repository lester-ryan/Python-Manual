Lists are useful because they provide us with a means of grouping several variables into a single variable. The value of each variable is known as a list element and these can be accessed by using the same indexing/slicing techniques as was described in the previous section on strings.
Just think about it. Thus far we have been using variables to store single values. This has been the case regardless of the variableâ€™s datatype i.e. whether it is a string or numeric, only one value at a time can be stored in it.
The main purpose of lists it to provide a mechanism for dealing with multiple values using a single variable.
