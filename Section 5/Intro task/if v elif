'''In this program, 
we check if the number is positive or
negative or zero and 
display an appropriate message'''

num = 3.4

# Try these two variations as well:
# num = 0
# num = -4.5

if num > 0:
    print("Positive number") #check to see if num is > 0
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero") #if first condition is not met test this condition
else:
    print("Negative number") # if none of the above conditions are met do this

# its important to note the elif is more efficient than if
# if we one condition is met we should stop if we have completed task
# for example if I made a list of places to search for lost car keys id
# stop if i found them in first place i looked
