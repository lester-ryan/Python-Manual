# range
# for ranges are great as they create a list

# range can take 3 inputs
# 1 input =  range (10) this is by far the most common
#     this will start from 0 and up to 9(one less than range) and increment by 1


# if 2 range (2,10) then start from 2 and up to 9 and increment by 1

# if 3 range(2,10,2) then start from 2 up to 9 and increment by 2

# better than while loop cause i dont have to create variable and then initiate the counter
