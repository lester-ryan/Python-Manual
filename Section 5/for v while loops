# for loops

# less coding in for loops than while loops

# use of range
# range can take 3 inputs
# if 1 range (10)
then start from 0 and up to 9(one less than range) and increment by 1
# if 2 range (2,10) then start from 2 and up to 9 and increment by 1
# if 3 range(2,10,2) then start from 2 up to 9 and increment by 2
# better than while loop cause i dont have to create variable and then initiate the counter

# Simple for loop

# counter is an interation variable
# counter is a local variable

for counter in range(10):
    print("Hello World", counter)
    
# will print string and number counter 
# for loop will do something a certain number of times
# should degbug and step into to show students whats going on
# the range is basically the same as creating a list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,,7,8,9]
# range is creating a list, if no starting point told to list it starts at zero and increment by one unless told otherwise



print("Goodbye")

myList = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
for counter in myList:
    print ('Hello world again', counter)
#     this is the same as above, but the quicker cleaner solution is using range
# range can take 3 different inputs, if one number in range then it starts on zero, 2 inputs then it will start at first input and
# increment by one

# example with 3 inputs
# 3rd input is the amont of increments

for counter in range (1,21,2):
    print (counter)
