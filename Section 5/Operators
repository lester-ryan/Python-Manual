# Relational operators - compare 2 numberic operands
#  < , < = , >, >=, ==, ! =
# Find out what the above operators do
# Run programmes to test them


# Arithmitic

# Double click on line of code to introduce a break point

# Other Operators - is, in
print (5 is 5) 
print (5 is 6)

# Very useful to check list
mylist =  [1,2,3]

print ('pc'!= 'PC') #not equal will be true

# Logical operators - not, and , or
print (True)
print (not True)
print (False)
print (not False)
# run code to see what happens here
