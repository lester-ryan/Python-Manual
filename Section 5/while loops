# while loop
# as long as condition is met it will execute block of code over and over again

counter = 0
#this is the control variable and when i put it to zero im "initiating the variable"
# students often forget to initiate the variable


# now we introduce the keyword while, then boolean expression, then colon, then indented code (must be indented)
#need method in indented code to change control variable or else will go on forever

while counter < 5:
    print ("Hello world")
    counter= counter +1 #unless i do this the code will continue to execute
#     this is called incrementing the variable

# incrementing is important word

# loop will continue until condition for while loop is met

#same code but working backwards we are decrementing the variable
counter2= 20
while counter2 > 0:
    print(counter2)
    counter2 = counter2 -1
