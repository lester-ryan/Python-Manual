# If the number is positive, we print an appropriate message

number = 3
if number > 0:
    print(num, "is a positive number.")
print("This is always printed.")

number = -1
if num > 0:
    print(num, "is a positive number.")
print("This is also always printed.")

#note that the info is always printed as it is not indented so its not effect by conditional code
#amend the above example to allow user input and use elif condition rather than another block of conditional code
