#Task:
#1. Modify the code to allow the user to change the upper bound (eg 1-100)
#2. Modify the code to allow the user to change the number of guesses

import random

upperBound = int(input("Enter the upper bound: "))
number = random.randint(1, upperBound)
print(number) # have a sneak peek!

# Initialise a loop counter
counter = 0
tries = int(input("Enter the number of tries you want: "))

# Loop 3 times
while counter < tries:

    guess = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and "+str(upperBound)+": "))
    if guess == number:
        print("Correct")
        counter = 3 # exit the loop immediately!
    elif guess < number:
        print("Too low")
    else:
        print("Too high")

    counter = counter + 1

print("Goodbye")
